        <p id = "description_tree" class = "col-3 pl-0 desc_press">If you set aside a separate day for cardio, then remember that the fat burning process only starts after 40 minutes of training. That is, in total, you need to spend more than an hour on a treadmill or on an elliptical trainer. In the event that you perform a cardiosession immediately after strength training, then fat burning starts from the first minute, so 20 minutes will be enough for you.</p>

        <p id = "desc_back_one" class = "col-4 desc_back">Pumping back muscles is not so difficult. But not at all, so that if necessary it would be possible to put heavier on it. With the right approach, back training can make your body much more attractive. By cultivating a powerful back, you can burn more fat. Pumping back muscles is harder than arm muscles: your hands are working harder. Every time your workout your latitudinal ones become shorter.</p>
        <p id = "desc_back_two" class = "col-4 desc_back">Your back can play a big role in increasing strength for other lifts that you might not expect, such as a bench press. The muscles of the upper and middle back help stabilize the shoulder joints. The stronger and more stable your shoulders, the more weight you can lift in almost every exercise for your upper body.</p>
        <p id = "desc_back_tree" class = "col-4 desc_back">If you have ever had a backache, you know how bad it can be. Every movement your body makes will somehow affect your back, so pain means you fell and left - which is not at all fun!Strengthening the back muscles can help prevent these types of injuries and ensure smooth functioning of the whole body both during daily movements and during training.</p>

In reality, these are dozens of muscles, including not only pushing and pulling, but also stabilizers.</p>
        <p id = "desc_foot_two" class = "col-3 pl-0 desc_foot">But think about it. You use your legs to stand, walk, run and balance. They serve as your foundation and are responsible for the transfer of all power from your body to the earth. When your legs are weak, the rest of your body should compensate for the work that your legs cannot do.</p>
        <p id = "desc_foot_tree" class = "col-3 pl-0 desc_foot">Be careful not to dive into the leg workout too quickly. You can create a problem that throws you back. Consider strengthening your legs as a long-term project. A little goes a long way, and you should gradually build it up with constant efforts and daily use.</p>
